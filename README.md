# Recommendation Algorithm for Data Compression

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an algorithm which recommends which algorithm to use inorder to compress the data based on the file type,size and other preferences given by the user for the data which flows through the backbone network. 
## Project Structure

- `src/` : Contains the source code for the recommendation algorithm.
- `examples/` : Provides sample code and scenarios for using the algorithm.
- `tests/` : Contains test cases and sample data for testing.

## Dependencies

- 1. Programming Language and Environment: Choose a suitable programming language (e.g., Python) and set up the development environment.
  2. Data Collection and Processing: Libraries for handling different file types and extracting metadata from data packets.
  3. Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning: Libraries for building and training the recommendation model (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
  4. Algorithm Development: Libraries for implementing and testing compression algorithms (e.g., zlib, specialized image or video compression libraries).
  5. Networking Libraries: Tools for network communication, like sockets or higher-level network libraries.
